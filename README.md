# Cowrie Honeypot<img width="839" height="557" alt="Cowrie-log" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9e593ca-73f2-4a30-852e-6478f70eb235" />


## Overview
This project sets up a lightweight SSH honeypot using Cowrie inside a Docker container.  
It records failed login attempts, attacker IPs, usernames, and passwords.  
The data is then parsed with Python scripts that generate a Markdown report summarizing attack patterns.

This repository demonstrates practical cybersecurity monitoring, container isolation, and log analysis in a controlled environment.

---

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/cowrie-honeypot.git
cd cowrie-honeypot
```

### 2. Start the honeypot
The honeypot listens on port 2222 instead of the default SSH port 22. This keeps it separate from the systemâ€™s real SSH service and ensures that all activity is contained to the local machine.
It only becomes public if you manually change your Docker run command to -p 0.0.0.0:2222:2222,
```bash
mkdir -p logs data
docker run -d   --name cowrie-honeypot   -p 2222:2222   -e COWRIE_TELNET_ENABLED=false   -e COWRIE_SSH_LISTEN_PORT=2222   --mount type=bind,src="$PWD/logs",dst=/cowrie/cowrie-git/var/log/cowrie   --mount type=bind,src="$PWD/data",dst=/cowrie/cowrie-git/var/lib/cowrie   cowrie/cowrie
```
On Apple Silicon, add `--platform linux/amd64` after `docker run -d`.

### 3. Generate activity
Connect to the honeypot and type any credentials several times:
```bash
ssh -p 2222 test@127.0.0.1
```
You should see "Permission denied" each time.

### 4. Parse the logs
```bash
python3 parser.py logs/cowrie.json
```

### 5. Create a summary report
```bash
python3 make_summary.py
```
This produces a file named `SUMMARY.md` that lists the top attacker IPs, usernames, passwords, and peak activity hours.

## Example Output

Example excerpt from `SUMMARY.md`:

| Metric | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Total events | 162 |
| Failed logins | 160 |
| Successful logins | 2 |

| IP | Attempts |
| --- | --- |
| 185.234.219.45 | 43 |
| 37.49.230.19 | 28 |

| Username | Attempts |
| --- | --- |
| root | 89 |
| admin | 36 |
| user | 11 |

---

## Tools Used
| Purpose | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Containerization | Docker |
| Honeypot | Cowrie |
| Language | Python |

---

## Results
Running the honeypot for several hours collected hundreds of failed SSH login attempts from global IP addresses.  
Common credentials included `root:123456` and `admin:password`.  
The Python scripts automate log parsing and produce readable Markdown summaries suitable for documentation or reports.
